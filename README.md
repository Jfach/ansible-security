# Ansible for security automation

Creation of an Ansible workflow and containers that allow safe, tested contributions to security configuration items such as

- Firewall configuration
- Security Groups

If this becomes mature enough (tests are written) it could conceivably be used for Threat, Vulnerability and Patch management as well.

This project makes use of project items already created

- Ansible controllers
- Github
- Autostaging github pull requests
- Continuous Integration (CircleCI)
